# 🚀 30 Days of Verilog

Welcome to the **30 Days of Verilog** challenge — a structured and hands-on journey into the world of **digital design and Verilog HDL**.

This repository documents my daily progress, learning, and implementation of 30 Verilog-based projects, each designed to deepen understanding of fundamental and advanced digital logic design concepts.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ **Master Verilog HDL** through consistent daily practice.
- 🧠 **Design digital circuits** to understand their internal working.
- 🧪 **Simulate and test** circuits using testbenches and waveforms.
- ✍️ **Document insights** including problems faced and how I solved them.
- 🌍 **Share this journey** as a learning resource for others in the community.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each day's folder contains:

- `Verilog Code`: Main implementation in Verilog.
- `Testbench/Simulation`: Waveforms, testbenches, or logs (if applicable).
